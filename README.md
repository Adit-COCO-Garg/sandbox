## ðŸ‘¾ Sandbox of experiments and love - a playground/ test-site ðŸ¥½
  
A portfolio? A sketchbook? A website? We may never know, all we know it's Adit's website of crazy cool experiments.  
  
The deeper you dig the more you question the insanity of the experiments ran under the hood. Don't be fooled by the simple sweet UI. 

This whole sandbox project is an exploration into creating immersive experiences. This is just the first MVP.
