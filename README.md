# sandbox
A portfolio? A sketchbook? A website? We may never know 🤔

This whole sandbox project is an exploration into creating immersive experiences. This is just the first MVP.


The website uses up to date JavaScript (ECMAScript 2019), SCSS (SASS/ CSS), and HTML5 practices and features. It focuses on maximizing efficiency using appropriate languages, plugins, libraries, etc wherever needed.
