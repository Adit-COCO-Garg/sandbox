Click the < [Link](aditgarg.me/test "Link to the test site") > to the test site!  
This directory is very dangerous and proceed with caution, features are under development and under constant testing.  
I take inspiration from sources like Dribble, Behance, Awwwards and mush them together into a creation somewhat as cool and a bit freaky as frankenstein's.  

Feel free to clone and play around, you may notice some experimental JavaScript features that were announced recently or mind bending SCSS (superset of CSS, it's very cool) tricks and nifty plugins, frameworks, and libraries. ðŸ¤“
